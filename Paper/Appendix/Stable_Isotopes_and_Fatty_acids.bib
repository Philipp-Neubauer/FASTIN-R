	abstract = {Use of stable isotope ratios to trace pathways of organic matter among consumers requires knowledge of the isotopic shift between diet and consumer. Variation in trophic shift among consumers can be substantial. For data from the published literature and supplementary original data (excluding fluid-feeding consumers), the mean isotopic shift for C was +0.5±0.13‰ rather than 0.0‰, as commonly assumed. The shift for C was higher for consumers analyzed as muscle (+1.3±0.30‰) than for consumers analyzed whole (+0.3±0.14‰). Among consumers analyzed whole, the trophic shift for C was lower for consumers acidified prior to analysis (−0.2±0.21‰) than for unacidified samples (+0.5±0.17‰). For N, trophic shift was lower for consumers raised on invertebrate diets (+1.4±0.21‰) than for consumers raised on other high-protein diets (+3.3±0.26‰) and was intermediate for consumers raised on plant and algal diets (+2.2±0.30‰). The trophic shift for S differed between high-protein (+2.0±0.65‰) and low-protein diets (-0.5±0.56‰). Thus, methods of analysis and dietary differences can affect trophic shift for consumers; the utility of stable isotope methods can be improved if this information is incorporated into studies of trophic relationships. Although few studies of stable isotope ratios have considered variation in the trophic shift, such variation is important because small errors in estimates of trophic shift can result in large errors in estimates of the contribution of sources to consumers or in estimates of trophic position.},

The contents of 54 stomachs (50 from squid collected near Macquarie Island and 4 from squid collected near Heard Island) were examined visually, and prey remains were identified to species level where possible. Myctophid fish were the most common prey item in the stomach contents of M. ingens and were identified in 59\% of stomachs. In total, teleost fish remains were found in 96\% of stomachs. The lipid class and fatty acid profiles of the digestive gland and mantle tissue were analysed for 5 to 6 squid from each area, in addition to 4 stomach fluid samples taken from Heard Island animals. Mantle tissue was low in lipid, and contained high concentrations of phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Digestive gland tissue had a high lipid content, with a mean value of 26.8 ± 12.9\% wet mass in Macquarie Island squid and 41.7 ± 8.5\% wet mass in Heard Island squid, and was rich in triacylglycerol ({TAG)} and monounsaturated fatty acids ({MUFA).} Stomach fluid generally contained high concentrations of {TAG}, although 1 sample was high in wax ester. Stomach fluid was also characterised by high {MUFA} concentrations. The digestive gland of M. ingens grouped with the fatty acid profile of stomach fluid and some myctophid species in cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, and appears to be a source of fatty acid dietary tracers. Thus the fatty acid profile of the digestive gland supports findings from stomach contents analyses that myctophids, particularly {TAG-rich} species, are an important prey group of M. ingens at Macquarie and Heard Islands. This combination of techniques has a potential to increase our knowledge of the feeding ecology of squids in the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {* {1Naturally} occurring stable isotopes in resources and their consumer allow the estimation of nutritional flows between the two and have been much used to improve our understanding of the nutritional ecology of free-living animals. * {2The} difference in isotopic composition between an animal and its diet is represented by a discrimination factor. Carbon and nitrogen flows are estimated by calculating the discrimination factors in stable isotope ratios ({δ15N} and {δ13C)}, which are presumed to be c. 3‰ and 1‰ heavier in the consumer tissues than those in their resources, respectively. * {3The} discrimination factor is known to vary according to species, tissue, age, growth rates and food quality, but the estimation of discrimination factors is difficult and a fixed discrimination factor is usually used in diet reconstruction. It has also been suggested that discrimination factors could vary linearly with the diet isotopic ratio. If this linear relationship could be demonstrated using regression, this would provide an adequate method for the estimation of discrimination factors. In order to understand how diet isotopic ratios affect the discrimination factor, we investigated the pattern of its change in nitrogen ({Δ15N)} and carbon ({Δ13C)} in different tissues (liver, muscle and hair) of an omnivore species, the rat Rattus rattus. We fed captive rats with diets of the same nutritional quality but on different isotopic ratios. * {4First}, discrimination factors for {Δ15N} and {Δ13C} showed great variability, ranging from –1·46‰ to 4·59‰ and from –8·79‰ to 0·64‰, respectively. Discrimination factors depended on both diet isotopic ratio and tissue. * {5We} also show that isotope ratios in shaved hairs showed a turnover during the first month, and then stabilized during the second month. Using shaved hairs has the potential to be an effective non-lethal method for determining resource shifts in non-specialist consumers. * {6Finally}, we demonstrated, for all tissues, a decrease of {Δ15N} and {Δ13C} with an increased values of {δ15N} and {δ13C}, respectively. These relationships allow us to propose a framework to estimate discrimination factors from diet isotopic ratios by means of regression models.},

In the northern hemisphere, adult abalone are considered to consume predominantly brown algae, but in the southern hemisphere abalone are thought to prefer red algae. Conventional methods such as gut content analysis and feeding trials provide some insight into diet choice, but the associated biases of these techniques create uncertainty surrounding the aforementioned variability in abalone diet. We use combined stable isotope and fatty acid analysis to determine the relative contribution of red algae, brown algae and detritus/microalgae to the diet of wild abalone in Tasmanian waters. Stable isotopes of carbon suggest that brown algae and/detritus are a more important source of carbon than red algae. Fatty acid analysis confirmed the larger contribution of brown algae to the diet of abalone, and also identified the bacterial and diatom component of detritus to be an important contributor to abalone diet. These results show combined use of chemical tracers to be a promising technique for resolving abalone diet, and challenge current perceptions regarding spatial variability in abalone diet choice.},

Experimental evidence (9 species/13 studies) shows that digestion strongly influences the proportion and size of otoliths that can be recovered in feces. Number correction factors ({NCF)} and digestion coefficients have been experimentally determined to reduce the biases in fecal analysis. Correction factors and coefficients have not been determined for diet estimated from stomach contents. {QFASA} estimates which prey species and amounts must have been eaten to account for the fatty acid composition of the predator. Experimental studies on mammals and seabirds (9 species/10 studies) indicate that accurate estimates of diet can be determined using {QFASA.} Stable isotope mixing models provide rather coarse taxonomic resolution of diet composition. Prey {DNA} analysis shows promise as a method to estimate the species composition of diet, but further development and testing is needed to validate its use. Obtaining a representative sample from marine mammal populations is a significant challenge. Therefore, the use of complementary methods is recommended to obtain the most informative results.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Omnivores play an important role in the routing and distribution of organic matter across food webs. We demonstrate a novel approach to quantifying the coincidence of landscape-scale nutritional gradients with niche breadth in terms of variability in trophic level and use of basal organic matter sources. We provide an example of the links between individual variability in resource use and habitat of a broad-spectrum omnivore, the red rock lobster Jasus edwardsii. Information on the co-occurrence of J. edwardsii with kelp bed habitats Ecklonia radiata and with their preferred prey Mytilus edulis galloprovinciallis were collected at 60 sites across Fiordland, southwest New Zealand. Analysis of distance-based linear models ({DISTLM)} indicated that the presence of mussels was the best predictor of lobster occurrence in the model set. At a subset of sites, we collected lobster muscle for stable isotope analysis and measured 3 demographic parameters from the lobsters: relative abundance, sex and carapace lengths. We characterised habitats with surveys of common kelp and mussels. Using stable isotope signatures ({δ13C} and {δ15N)}, we calculated individual-based estimates of trophic level and the mixture of organic matter sources, i.e. phytoplankton and macroalgae. Using {DISTLM}, lobster and mussel densities best explained variability in lobster diet. Variability in resource use was distinct inside and outside of kelp bed habitat. In kelp beds, lobsters fed at a higher average trophic level, with low variability among individuals in trophic level and use of organic matter sources. Outside kelp beds, individual variability indicated broad trophic diversification. These patterns indicate a strong influence of the nutritional landscape at the scale of the metapopulation, which has important implications for understanding dietary influences on population structure.},

Smaller squid had frequently consumed crustaceans and cephalopods; fish were of secondary importance. Larger squid consumed mostly fish and moderate amounts of cephalopods, but had rarely consumed crustaceans. These findings were supported by comparisons drawn between digestive-gland fatty-acid profiles and the fatty-acid profiles of potential prey species. Fatty-acid analyses indicated that the crustaceans Euphausia lucens, Munida gregaria and Themisto gaudichaudii were important prey items of smaller squid, whereas stomach content and fatty-acid analyses indicated that Gymnoscopelus nicholsi of around 100 mm standard length represented much of the fish prey of larger squid.},

	abstract = {Cephalopods play a key role in the marine environment but knowledge of their feeding habits is limited by lack of data. Here, we have developed a new tool to investigate their feeding ecology by combining the use of their predators as biological samplers together with measurements of the stable isotopic signature of their beaks. Cephalopod beaks are chitinous hard structures that resist digestion and the stable isotope ratios of carbon ({δ13C)} and nitrogen ({δ15N)} are indicators of the foraging areas and trophic levels of consumers, respectively. First, a comparison of {δ13C} and {δ15N} values of different tissues from the same individuals showed that beaks were slightly enriched in {13C} but highly impoverished in {15N} compared with lipid-free muscle tissues. Second, beaks from the same species showed a progressive increase in their {δ15N} values with increasing size, which is in agreement with a dietary shift from lower to higher trophic levels during cephalopod growth. In the same way, there was an increase in the {δ15N} signature of various parts of the same lower beaks in the order rostrum, lateral walls and wings, which reflects the progressive growth and chitinization of the beaks in parallel with dietary changes. Third, we investigated the trophic structure of a cephalopod community for the first time. Values of {δ15N} indicate that cephalopods living in slope waters of the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands (n=18 species) encompass almost three distinct trophic levels, with a continuum of two levels between crustacean- and fish-eaters and a distinct higher trophic level occupied by the colossal squid Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni. {δ13C} values demonstrated that cephalopods grow in three different marine ecosystems, with 16 species living and developing in Kerguelen waters and two species migrating from either Antarctica (Slosarczykovia circumantarctica) or the subtropics (the giant squid Architeuthis dux). The stable isotopic signature of beaks accumulated in predators' stomachs therefore revealed new trophic relationships and migration patterns and is a powerful tool to investigate the role of the poorly known cephalopods in the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Measurements of delta({15)N} of consumers are usually higher than those of their diet. This general pattern is widely used to make inferences about trophic relationships in ecological studies, although the underlying mechanisms causing the pattern are poorly understood. However, there can be substantial variation in consumer-diet delta({15)N} enrichment within this general pattern. We conducted an extensive literature review, which yielded 134 estimates from controlled studies of consumer-diet delta({15)N} enrichment, to test the significance of several potential sources of variation by means of meta-analyses. We found patterns related to processes of nitrogen assimilation and excretion. There was a significant effect of the main biochemical form of nitrogenous waste: ammonotelic organisms show lower delta({15)N} enrichment than ureotelic or uricotelic organisms. There were no significant differences between animals feeding on plant food, animal food, or manufactured mixtures, but detritivores yielded significantly lower estimates of enrichment. delta({15)N} enrichment was found to increase significantly with the {C:N} ratio of the diet, suggesting that a nitrogen-poor diet can have an effect similar to that already documented for fasting organisms. There were also differences among taxonomic classes: molluscs and crustaceans generally yielded lower delta({15)N} enrichment. The lower delta({15)N} enrichment might be related to the fact that molluscs and crustaceans excrete mainly ammonia, or to the fact that many were detritivores. Organisms inhabiting marine environments yielded significantly lower estimates of delta({15)N} enrichment than organisms inhabiting terrestrial or freshwater environments, a pattern that was influenced by the number of marine, ammonotelic, crustaceans and molluscs. Overall, our analyses point to several important sources of variation in delta({15)N} enrichment and suggest that the most important of them are the main biochemical form of nitrogen excretion and nutritional status. The variance of estimates of delta({15)N} enrichment, as well as the fact that enrichment may be different in certain groups of organisms should be taken into account in statistical approaches for studying diet and trophic relationships.},

The primary source of variance (as examined by permutational {ANOVA)} for all biomarkers examined was amongst primary producer types, as opposed to amongst species within type. {δ13C} showed a clear separation (Monte Carlo p \&lt; 0.05) between seagrass (range of means = −10.1 to −14.0‰) and macroalgae (−14.6 to −25.2‰), but could not differentiate amongst the algal types examined. Similarly, distinct {δ15N} signatures (p \&lt; 0.05) were found only for seagrass (range of means = 3.6–4.1‰) versus calcareous red algae (4.6–5.5‰), with all other types overlapping in their mean {δ15N} values. In contrast, multivariate analysis of fatty acid data (using Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates; {CAP)} distinguished not only between seagrass and macroalgae, but also between red and brown algae (and to a limited extent between the calcareous and fleshy red algal types). The principal unsaturated fatty acids in the samples were C20 polyunsaturates (found primarily in the macroalgae and periphyton), and C18 mono- and polyunsaturates, with high proportions of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 typical of the seagrasses. The C18 monounsaturate 18:1n-7 was one of the most diagnostic compounds for the red algae examined, being present in very low amounts in seagrass and virtually absent in the brown algae. Conversely, brown algae were high in 18:4n-3, with 20:4n-3 particularly diagnostic of the kelp Ecklonia radiata. In contrast to stable isotopes, fatty acids helped distinguish different algal groups, thereby providing support that a two-dimensional approach using stable isotopes and fatty acids is likely to provide the most useful tool to distinguish primary producers in food web structure.},

Total lipid, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals among several life stages. Lipids in seston and major copepods representing potential diets were collected from the water column and quantified to compare with krill. Stomach contents also were examined in selected adult krill to provide a visual snapshot of ingested material and comparison with lipid biomarkers. Total lipids in adult E. crystallorophias were significantly higher than adult E. superba (30.0\% and 20.2\% of dry weight, respectively). Wax esters were the major storage lipid in E. crystallorophias, accounting for over half (mean of 55.9\%) of the total lipid in adult animals. In contrast, E. superba contained triacylglycerols as the dominant storage lipid in adults (mean of 45.5\% of total lipid). Fatty acid and sterol distributions in krill showed minor differences between species and life stages. Larval krill, however, contained higher polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFA)} than sub- and adult krill. While only trace amounts of fatty alcohols were found in E. superba, significant amounts were found in E. crystallorophias, particularly 14:0 and 16:0, which were major components of wax esters. Results for lipid classes, individual lipids, and stomach content suggest that E. superba is less dependent on stored lipid for overwintering than E. crystallorophias. E. superba are omnivorous, with copepods representing a significant dietary source for adults in winter. Furciliae of both species contain lower levels of lipid storage in winter and feed largely on detritus or organisms associated with ice.},

As a result, statistical methods are rapidly evolving and numerous models have been produced to estimate the diets of animals—each with their benefits and their limitations. Deciding which {SIMM} to use is contingent on factors such as the consumer of interest, its food sources, sample size, the familiarity a user has with a particular framework for statistical analysis, or the level of inference the researcher desires to make (e.g., population- or individual-level). In this paper, we provide a review of commonly used {SIMM} models and describe a comprehensive {SIMM} that includes all features commonly used in {SIMM} analysis and two new features. We used data collected in Yosemite National Park to demonstrate {IsotopeR's} ability to estimate dietary parameters. We then examined the importance of each feature in the model and compared our results to inferences from commonly used {SIMMs.} {IsotopeR's} user interface (in R) will provide researchers a user-friendly tool for {SIMM} analysis.

	abstract = {Fatty acid biomarkers and stable isotope signatures were used to identify the trophic dynamics of a mangrove/seagrass estuarine food web at Matapouri, northern New Zealand. Specific fatty acids were used to identify the preferred food sources (i.e., mangroves, seagrass, phytoplankton, macroalgae, bacteria, and zooplankton) of dominant fauna (i.e., filter feeders, grazing snails, scavenger/predatory snails, shrimp, crabs, and fish), and their presence in water and sediment samples throughout the estuary. The diets of filter feeders were found to be dominated by dinoflagellates, whereas grazers showed a higher diatom contribution. Bacteria associated with organic debris on surface sediments and brown algal (Hormosira banksii) material in the form of suspended organic matter also accounted for a high proportion of most animal diets. Animals within higher trophic levels had diverse fatty acid profiles, revealing their varied feeding strategies and carbon sources. The stable isotope ({δ13C} and {δ15N)} analyses of major primary producers and consumers/predators revealed a trend of {15N} enrichment with increasing trophic level, while {δ13C} values provided a generally good description of carbon flow through the food web. Overall results from both fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes indicate that a variety of carbon sources with a range of trophic pathways typify this food web. Moreover, none of the animals studied was dependent on a single food source. This study is the first to use a comprehensive fatty acid biomarker and stable isotope approach to investigate the food web dynamics within a New Zealand temperate mangrove/seagrass estuary. This quantitative research may contribute to the currently developing management strategies for estuaries in northern New Zealand, especially for those perceived to have expanding mangrove fringes.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Carbon and sulfur stable isotope ratios, as well as fatty acid composition of tissues, of dominant consumer species were determined and compared to those of potential food sources in an isolated community of Zostera marina in a shallow, semi-enclosed inlet of the Sea of Japan. Of the 6 dominant species of invertebrates, 4 species were enriched in {13C}, compared to all sampled carbon sources alternative to Z. marina. Among them, the grazing gastropods Littorina squalida and Homalopoma sangarense exhibited the most enriched {δ13C} values. On the dual {δ13C} versus {δ34S} plot, these mollusks occupy an intermediate position between Z. marina and epiphytes, suggesting nearly equal proportions of organic carbon from both nutritional sources. In lipids of H. sangarense there was a high content of the 18:1(n-7) acid characteristic of aerobic bacteria; however, another grazer (L. squalida) showed the lowest content of bacterial fatty acids among all consumers. Other highly {13C-enriched} consumers were the surface-deposit-feeding mollusks, the gastropod Batillaria cumingii and the bivalve Macoma incongrua; however, their {δ34S} values were markedly lower than those of any of the primary producers sampled, including Z. marina. Although the high {δ13C} values of grazers and surface-deposit feeders are suggestive of a great contribution of Z. marina organic carbon, no substantial concentrations of seagrass marker fatty acids were detected. Significant interspecific variations of both the sulfur isotope ratios and the fatty acid composition of these consumers suggest that there are a variety of pathways by which seagrass organic matter reaches invertebrates at lower trophic levels of the community food web. Dominant filter feeders, the bivalves Ruditapes philippinarum and Pillucina pisidium, had carbon drastically different in isotopic composition from Z. marina organic matter. Body tissues of P. pisidium and especially its gills, which bear symbiotic bacteria, were dramatically depleted both in {13C} and {34S} compared to all sources of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the bay. Very low {δ13C} and {δ34S} values of P. pisidium body together with a high content of 18:1(n-7) acid suggest a leading role of sulfur-oxidizing symbiotic bacteria in the nutrition of this species. R. philippinarum was only slightly {13C-enriched}, compared to {POM}, and was the only consumer which had the high concentration of fatty acids characteristic of plankton, particularly 22:6(n-3). At the same time, it was much more {34S-depleted} than would be expected, assuming negligible contribution of Z. marina detritus to its food. This mollusk showed a high content of branched fatty acids, especially the iso17:0 and anteiso17:0 acids characteristic of bacteria from sediment; this suggests that R. philippinarum assimilated notable amounts of bacteria from resuspended sediment. Furthermore, the contribution of {34S-depleted} bacteria, which inhabit reduced sediment, to R. philippinarum nutrition was high enough to result in the observed depletion of {34S} in mollusks. Further progress in food web studies of seagrass ecosystems using a complex of multiple stable isotope and fatty acid analyses would appear possible on the basis of analysis of separate components of the seagrass epiphytic community and micro- and meiobenthic organisms, inhabiting surface sediments.},

Combined stomach content and fatty acid ({FA)} signature analyses provided clear evidence of seasonal dietary shifts in prey composition. Teleost fish remains (mainly otoliths) were found in 67\% of stomachs with the two mesopelagic planktivorous fish, Lampanyctodes hectoris and Maurolicus muelleri dominating. Cephalopods and crustaceans were supplementary dietary components, with an increased representation in the diet over winter. Digestive gland lipid content was moderate (16.4 ± 8.4\% wet weight) and was rich in triacylglycerol and monounsaturated fatty acids. Multivariate analysis of {FA} profiles grouped arrow squid with profiles of mesopelagic fish and cephalopods, thus supporting the findings of stomach content analysis. Seasonal differences in total lipid content were likely related to summer upwelling events and local changes in productivity, while intraspecific differences in lipid class and {FA} composition were related to seasonal differences of prey consumption. {FA} analyses also demonstrated dietary differences associated with gender, size and female maturation. Such relationships demonstrate that the diet of N. gouldi is closely linked to prey size, abundance and availability and possibly also, to key life-history stages.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} The degree of reliance of newborn sharks on energy reserves from maternal resource allocation and the timescales over which these animals develop foraging skills are critical factors towards understanding the ecological role of top predators in marine ecosystems. We used muscle tissue stable carbon isotopic composition and fatty acid analysis of bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas to investigate early-life feeding ecology in conjunction with maternal resource dependency. Values of {δ13C} of some young-of-the-year sharks were highly enriched, reflecting inputs from the marine-based diet and foraging locations of their mothers. This group of sharks also contained high levels of the 20:3ω9 fatty acid, which accumulates during periods of essential fatty acid deficiency, suggesting inadequate or undeveloped foraging skills and possible reliance on maternal provisioning. A loss of maternal signal in {δ13C} values occurred at a length of approximately 100 cm, with muscle tissue {δ13C} values reflecting a transition from more freshwater/estuarine-based diets to marine-based diets with increasing length. Similarly, fatty acids from sharks {\textgreater}100 cm indicated no signs of essential fatty acid deficiency, implying adequate foraging. By combining stable carbon isotopes and fatty acids, our results provided important constraints on the timing of the loss of maternal isotopic signal and the development of foraging skills in relation to shark size and imply that molecular markers such as fatty acids are useful for the determination of maternal resource dependency.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} What animals consume is perhaps one of the most fundamental questions in ecology. Limitations of stomach content and faecal analyses have led to the development of alternative biochemical methods, namely fatty acid ({FA)} signature analysis and stable isotope ({SI)} analysis. Proportional estimates of diet composition can be made at the level of the individual by statistically matching a consumer’s {FA} signature to an inclusive prey database, after accounting for predator metabolism effects in a mixing model. Both of these approaches provide inferences about or quantitative estimates of diet that are time-integrated and readily applied to most taxa of interest, thereby alleviating many problems associated with conventional analysis. Moreover, analysis is done at the level of individual predators, thereby increasing our ability to detect differences amongst various demographic groups. However, it is difficult to validate diet estimates from either of these methods in the field, particularly for wide-ranging aquatic predators such as seals or seabirds consuming complex diets. Concurrent sampling of individual predators for both stable isotopes and fatty acids provide 1 such independent test. To that effect, we analyzed {SI} and {FA} for grey seals Halichoerus grypus (n = 75) and potential fish and invertebrate prey (n = 45). We show 2 lines of evidence for the convergence of stable isotope and fatty acid estimates of diet. First, in fish, invertebrates and grey seals, principal components derived from fatty acid signatures are correlated to the stable-carbon isotope ({δ13C)} signature of the same species. Second, both the estimated portion of pelagic prey and the trophic level of the diet derived from the quantitative analysis of fatty acid signatures of individual seals are positively correlated with the stable-carbon ({δ13C)} and stable-nitrogen ({δ15N)} signatures in those same individuals. The corroboration of independent measures of diet provides further validation of these biochemical methods to understand the foraging ecology of consumers.},

Samples of eelgrass, epiphytic algae, sand microflora, red algae, phytoplankton and main consumer species were collected in June 2002. {δ13C} values of primary producers ranged from –9.6‰ for eelgrass to the most depleted value of –34.9‰ for the most abundant red alga, Delesseria sanguinea. Epiphyte {δ13C} (–11.3‰) was close to the value for eelgrass, whereas sand microflora and phytoplankton showed intermediate values (–20.0 and –22.6‰, respectively). {δ13C} values of consumer species varied from –12.2‰ in the gastropod Lacuna vincta to –23.9‰ in the amphipod Amphitoe rubricata. Epiphytes, sand microflora and phytoplankton had relatively similar fatty acid signatures, indicating a dominance of diatoms. Fatty acid composition of the main consumers included the biomarker fatty acids for diatoms and red algae, whereas those for eelgrass were negligible. The stable isotope data in combination with the results of the fatty acid analysis strongly indicated that the food web in this eelgrass community was based on epiphytes, sand microflora and red algae. Additionally, the continuous distribution of {δ15N} values implied a food web that was characterized by a large proportion of generalist feeders in every group of consumers and by a high degree of omnivory.},

	abstract = {Assessing the trophic role and interaction of an animal is key to understanding its general ecology and dynamics. Conventional techniques used to elucidate diet, such as stomach content analysis, are not suitable for large threatened marine species. Non-lethal sampling combined with biochemical methods provides a practical alternative for investigating the feeding ecology of these species. Stable isotope and signature fatty acid analyses of muscle tissue were used for the first time to examine assimilated diet of the reef manta ray Manta alfredi, and were compared with different zooplankton functional groups (i.e. near-surface zooplankton collected during manta ray feeding events and non-feeding periods, epipelagic zooplankton, demersal zooplankton and several different zooplankton taxa). Stable isotope {δ15N} values confirmed that the reef manta ray is a secondary consumer. This species had relatively high levels of docosahexaenoic acid ({DHA)} indicating a flagellate-based food source in the diet, which likely reflects feeding on {DHA-rich} near-surface and epipelagic zooplankton. However, high levels of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and slightly enriched {δ13C} values in reef manta ray tissue suggest that they do not feed solely on pelagic zooplankton, but rather obtain part of their diet from another origin. The closest match was with demersal zooplankton, suggesting it is an important component of the reef manta ray diet. The ability to feed on demersal zooplankton is likely linked to the horizontal and vertical movement patterns of this giant planktivore. These new insights into the habitat use and feeding ecology of the reef manta ray will assist in the effective evaluation of its conservation needs.},

Diet quality was also found to affect consumer-diet discrimination, with high protein pilchard diet leading to lower {δ15N} and higher {δ13C} discrimination.

A broad size range of juvenile alvinocaridid shrimp, Opaepele loihi and Alvinocaris sp. M (diagnosis in preparation by R. Webber), were collected from active sites on {NW} Rota-1 and {NW} Eifuku volcanoes. Fatty acid biomarkers and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen revealed a photosynthetic signal in small juveniles of both species, probably acquired during a pelagic larval phase. Size-related changes in the fatty acid composition of both species indicated a dietary switch from pelagic feeding on photosynthetic material to ingestion of bacteria at vent sites after settlement. This is especially true for O. loihi, where carbon isotopic signatures implied ingestion of bacteria with form {II} {RuBisCo.} Juvenile Alvinocaris sp. M also appear to have eaten bacteria, although probably those with form I {RuBisCo;} detritus may also feature in their diet at an early stage. With increasing size, the fatty acid and isotopic composition of Alvinocaris sp. M implied a lesser dependence on bacterivory and a possible switch to carnivory. Generally, Alvinocaris sp. M and O. loihi are more similar in their biochemical composition to opportunistic alvinocaridids than to strict bacterivores. We suggest that as juveniles both species rely to varying degrees on bacteria and that opportunism and scavenging are likely sources of nutrition in older individuals.},

Both techniques show a diet that is closely linked to prey availability and abundance, with some specialisation occurring for Myctophid fishes which dominated the diet numerically and taxonomically. Mean monthly differences in total lipid content of the digestive gland correlated with satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll, illustrating that the diet is closely linked to short-term (monthly) temporal changes of primary productivity. Multidimensional scaling analysis of prey and T. filippovae signature fatty acid profiles revealed apparent intra-specific predator to prey relationships. Significant season versus site interactions for various lipid classes and fatty acids were observed, further indicating that temporal dietary shifts are related to site-specific oceanography and ecosystem structure (prey composition and/or productivity). Comparing fatty acid profiles with other Southern Ocean squid species, interspecific similarities and differences in diet composition were evident. Results demonstrate that signature lipid profiling of squid can be used as a complimentary or even alternative and cost effective tool to examine key changes in prey-community structure and ecosystem productivity. Such knowledge is fundamental to better understanding the effects of environmental perturbations from fisheries, climate change and pollution.},

consumption models to name a few. Iverson et al. (2004) developed a method based on the

acids are the basic building blocks of most lipids and are indicative of diet, in the sense that
higher level predators have limited ability to modify the fatty acids they ingest.
Billheimer (2001) introduced a Bayesian compositional receptor model, where he apportioned
the air pollution recorded a receptor site in Juneau Alaska into two components,
woodstove smoke and automobile emissions. Building on this model we add components
to allow for predator biosynthesis and differential fat content and also introduce a model
which allows for design effects.
Additionally we give some interesting results on the multi–modality of the logistic normal
distribution. We also generalize the test of stationarity proposed by Priestley and Subba
Rao (1969), based on evolutionary spectral ideas, as an alternative way of assessing when a
{MCMC} sampler has reached its stationary distribution.

The most widely used application is quantifying the diet of organisms based on the food sources they have been observed to consume. At the centre of the multivariate statistical model we propose is a compositional mixture of the food sources corrected for various metabolic factors. The compositional component of our model is based on the isometric log ratio (ilr) transform of Egozcue (2003).

	abstract = {* {1The} use of stable isotopic techniques to study animal diets and trophic levels requires a priori estimates of discrimination factors ({Δ13C} and {Δ15N}, also called fractionation factors), which are the differences in isotopic composition between an animal and its diet. Previous studies have shown that these parameters depend on several sources of variation (e.g. taxon, environment, tissue) but diet as a source of variation still needs assessment. * {2We} conducted an extensive review of the literature (66 publications) concerning estimates of animal-diet {Δ13C} (n = 290) and {Δ15N} (n = 268). We analysed this data set to test the effect of diet isotopic ratio on the discrimination factor, taking into account taxa, tissues, environments and lipid extraction treatments. Our results showed differences among taxonomic classes for {Δ13C}, but not for {Δ15N}, and significant differences among tissues for both {Δ13C} and {Δ15N.} We found a significant negative relationship between both, {Δ13C} and {Δ15N}, with their corresponding diet isotopic ratios. This relationship was found also within taxonomic classes for mammals ({Δ13C} and {Δ15N)}, birds ({Δ13C)}, fishes ({Δ13C} and {Δ15N)} and invertebrates ({Δ13C} and {Δ15N).} From these relationships, we propose a method to calculate discrimination factors based on data on diet isotope ratios (termed the {‘Diet-Dependent} Discrimination Factor’, {DDDF).} * {3To} investigate current practice in the use of discrimination factors, we reviewed studies that used multi-resource isotopic models. More than 60\% of models used a discrimination factor coming from a different species or tissues, and in more than 70\% of models, only one {Δ13C} or {Δ15N} was used for all resources, even if resources had very different isotopic ratios. Also, we estimated {DDDFs} for the studies that used isotopic models. More than 40\% used {Δ15N} values and more than 33\% used {Δ13C} values differing {\textgreater} 2‰ from estimated {DDDFs.} * {4Synthesis} and applications. Over the last decade, applied ecologists have discovered the potential of stable isotopes for animal diet reconstruction, but the successful adoption of the method relies on a good estimation of discrimination factors. We draw attention to the high variability in discrimination factors, advise caution in the use of single discrimination factors in isotopic models, and point to a method for obtaining adequate values for this parameter when discrimination factors cannot be measured experimentally. Future studies should focus on understanding why discrimination factors vary as a function of the isotopic value of the diet.},

	abstract = {Carbon isotopic fractionation was investigated in fatty acids ({FA)} of adipose tissue and blood serum of threatened Steller's eiders (Polysticta stelleri) and spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) relative to the {FA} in their diets. Captive eiders were fed a known diet for 180 days with serum sampled at 60, 120 and 180 days immediately after a 12 fast; adipose was collected at 180 days. Essential {FA} ({EFA)} in the adipose showed varying degrees of isotope fractionation (0–4‰), depending on {FA} structure. The {δ13C} values of long-chain {FA} 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 did not differ from those in the diet, while those of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 were ∼2‰ greater than in the diet. The {δ13C} values of free {FA} ({FFA)} in serum were not consistent within individuals or sampling dates; fractionation varied randomly, suggesting that {FFA} were arising from diet, rather than mobilization from adipose tissue. Discrimination factors were used in combination with a mixing model incorporating {FA} and lipid concentrations to estimate the diet of eiders fed a binary mixture with contrasting isotopic signatures. Diet estimates varied with {FA} but mean values closely approximated the actual proportions consumed. By tracking {EFA}, this study avoided the complications in interpretation arising from isotopic routing of carbon in bulk isotope analyses and serves as a basis for the development of compound-specific isotopic methods to trace dietary input in wild eiders. However, our understanding of the processes contributing to the variation in isotopic signatures of {FA} in nature is currently limited, and we recommend that future research directions focus on elucidating these mechanisms.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Each year, millions of seabirds migrate to the North Water Polynya, northern Baffin Bay, to feed in its productive waters during the 6 months that the polynya is free of ice. We evaluated seasonal shifts in diets of 3 species using the North Water: dovekie Alle alle, thick-billed murre Uria lomvia, and black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. Diets were assessed through a combination of stable isotope analysis of muscle tissue, fatty acid analysis of subcutaneous fat, and stomach content analysis. Dovekies had the lowest {δ15N} values and hence lowest trophic level in spring and summer, corresponding to their consumption of herbivorous copepods. In fall, their {δ15N} values increased as they switched to feeding at a higher trophic level on primary carnivores such as amphipods and fish. Throughout the study period, kittiwakes and murres had stomach contents and stable isotope values similar to dovekies in fall. Fatty acid signatures of black-legged kittiwakes and dovekies feeding in fall were similar, likely due to the reliance of both species on the pteropod Limacina limacina. Our study highlights the seasonal nature of prey availability and seabird diets in the polynya, as well as the utility of simultaneously using conventional stomach content analysis and stable isotope and fatty acid analyses to infer dietary patterns in marine food webs.},

	abstract = {Obtaining adequate dietary information for many shark and chimaera species has long been a challenge for ecosystem managers, largely due to logistical difficulties in the collection of large sample sizes required for stomach content analyses. Here, we use multivariate analysis of signature fatty acid ({FA)} profiles as a complementary method to examine the diet composition of 16 demersal shark and chimaera species, collected off south eastern Australia. Comparative results of {FA} profiles of potential prey and chondrichthyan species mostly agree with the stomach content data. Multivariate analysis correctly classified chimaeras as prominent low-order and benthic consumers, medium-sized dogfish as predators of mid-trophic fish and squid, catsharks as dominant cephalopod consumers, and larger and deeper dwelling dogfish as feeders of bathypelagic fish, squid and feeding on higher order species (cetaceans and seals). Our results demonstrate that signature {FA} analysis can be applied in dietary studies of sharks and chimaeras to (1) distinguish interspecific differences in general resource (diet and habitat) use patterns; (2) identify degrees of dietary specialisation; and (3) detect niche partitioning of resources by co-occurring species. The {FA} profiling approach is particularly valuable where sample numbers are likely to be low, such as for these deep-sea and threatened organisms.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} In several parts of the world, detached seagrass and macroalgae accumulate in the surf zone where in situ primary production can be low. This allochthonous resource is therefore likely to be important to consumers, but the various components of the resource likely play different roles in the food webs. We traced sources of production for the abundant amphipod Allorchestes compressa and 2 key predatory fishes in the surf zone of southwestern Australia using multiple stable isotopes ({δ13C}, {δ15N} and {δ34S)} and fatty acids. Seagrasses had higher {δ13C} than macroalgae, while {δ13C} of red and brown macroalgae were similar. Mixing models based on {δ13C} were ambiguous and indicated that brown algae and seagrasses were both feasible carbon sources for A. compressa. {δ15N} varied little between seagrasses and macroalgae, while {δ15N} of amphipods was higher and {δ15N} of fish higher again. {δ34S} was not useful in distinguishing between macrophytes or trophic levels. The fatty acid composition of brown and red algae and seagrasses were distinct. The composition of essential fatty acids (i.e. fatty acids that the consumer must obtain through its diet) of A. compressa was most similar to that of brown algae. The combination of stable isotope and fatty acid analyses indicates that, although brown algae comprises a lower proportion of wrack biomass than seagrass (17 to 28\% vs. 52 to 58\%), brown algae, particularly the kelp Ecklonia radiata, contributes disproportionately to the surf-zone food web in southwestern Australia.},

For example, {δ13C} and {δ15N} stable isotope values and most {POP} concentrations were significantly lower in the Antarctic population. In addition, multivariate statistical analyses of both fatty acid and {POP} profiles found distinctly different patterns for Antarctic Type C whales compared to those from whales in the other populations. Similar assays were conducted on four species of Antarctic marine fish considered potential prey for Type C killer whales. Results were consistent with a diet of fish for Type C whales, but other species (e.g., low trophic-level marine mammals or penguins) could not be eliminated as supplemental prey.},

Nitrogen stable isotopes ({δ15N)} provide a powerful tool to estimate {TP} but are limited by a pragmatic assumption that isotope discrimination is constant (change in {δ15N} between predator and prey, {Δ15N} = 3.4‰), resulting in an additive framework that omits known {Δ15N} variation. Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental {Δ15N} and {δ15N} values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled {Δ15N} framework estimated reliable {TPs} of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator {TP} estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified. The scaled {Δ15N} framework will greatly improve the accuracy of trophic estimates widely used in ecosystem-based management.},
