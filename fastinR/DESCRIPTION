Description: This packages provides gui facilities to perfom Bayesian estiamtion
    of diet proportions based on fatty acid profiles, stable isotopes and
    their combination. Bayesian estiamtion is currently performed using
    the R package rjags to call JAGS from R. The package can handle
    covariates and grouped (e.g., regional) data as predictors of diet
    proportions, and will estiamte both individual and popualtion level diet
    protportions. Facilities for simulating, plotting and extracting/writing
    summary statistics to file are provided as well.
