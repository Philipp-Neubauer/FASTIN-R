Description: This packages provides gui facilities to perfom Bayesian estiamtion 
             of diet proportions based on fatty acid profiles, stable isotopes and 
             their combination. Bayesian estiamtion is currently performed using 
             the R package BRugs to call OpenBUGS from R. The package can handle 
             covariates and grouped (e.g., regional) data as predictors of diet 
             proportions, and will estiamte both individual and popualtion level diet 
             protportions. Facilities for simulating, plotting and extracting/writing 
             summary statistics to file are provided as well.
